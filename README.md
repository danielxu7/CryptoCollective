# CryptoCollective

Crypto Collective aggregates tweets accessed through the Twitter API. It then processes these tweets using Microsoft Azure's text analytics service which returns numerical user sentiment data. This data was then formatted into a user friendly interface and displayed on our website. This will undoubtedly aid users in their cryptocurrency investments.

We built Crypto Collective using Node.Js, Express.Js, Heroku, HTML, CSS, and JQuery. We had to access the Twitter API and process the tweets. Then we had to pass this information to the Microsoft Analytics API which returned valuable user sentiment data. We then used this to determine if a certain cryptocoin was desirable or undesirable. This was then displayed on our site using percentages to convey desirability.
